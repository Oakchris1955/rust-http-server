# Introduction

**NOTE:** This project is still in early Beta. With that being said, lower your expectations.

The **Oak HTTP server** library, also called **OakHTTP**, is a personal project of mine aiming to create a HTTP server library in Rust whose usage is similar to that of the `express.js` JavaScript library.

## Contributing

OakHTTP is free and open source. You can find the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Oakchris1955/rust-http-server) and issues and feature requests can be posted on the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/Oakchris1955/rust-http-server/issues).

## License

The OakHTTP library and it's documentation are released under the [MIT License](https://github.com/Oakchris1955/rust-http-server/blob/main/LICENSE)
