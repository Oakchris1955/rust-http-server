# OakHTTP Server

A lightweight HTTP 1.1 server library, written in Rust with **MINIMUM** dependencies.

## Scope

The scope of this project is to create a stable, lightweight, easy-to-use library in Rust. To achieve this, this project tries to rely on the `std` instead of external crates as much as possible. When external crates are used, they are usually lightweight and actively-maintained.

Apart from that, this library also relies on many Rust-unique features to make the code more readable. For example, `Option`s and `Result`s are used for error-handling, while generics are also widely used
