# Rust HTTP1.1 Server

A HTTP server library that complies with the 1.1 version of the HTTP protocol according to `RFC 9112` and other related documents, written in Rust with **ZERO** dependencies.

This was originally meant to be an executable running a HTTP server, but it turns out it is way easier to implement a HTTP library, then use it in one's own executable.
